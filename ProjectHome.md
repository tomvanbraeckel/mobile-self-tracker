The goal of this project is to provide software that allows for [self-tracking](http://www.wordspy.com/words/self-tracker.asp) using your mobile phone.

A few examples of data we would certainly like to track are:
  * where you are: using GPS or other means
  * what you are seeing: by taking pictures or shooting video
  * what you are hearing: by recording audio
  * what you are doing: by manually or automatically registering activities that you are engaged in

In other words, this software will serve multiple, partially overlapping purposes, which include:
  * self tracking or self quantifying
  * mobile phone anti-theft

Supported phones:
  * All mobile phones running Android 1.5 or greater.
  * Maybe more to come, if someone wants to port this to another OS, we'll be happy to help out !
